========================

Dear Readers,

Knowledge sharing mission on telecommunication’s global trends
is extremely important matter for our company. That is why I am
delighted to present you the fifth part of the Nokia Book.

This time on 144 pages Nokia’s experts shared their wide knowledge and valuable
experience about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence concepts and their
applications in telecommunication networks and Nokia processes.

In Nokia we focus on future technologies creation and ML&AI development is essential
to stay on the right track. This would not be possible without our colleagues
experienced in data science or mathematics. This knowledge is directly applied to our
products and this is the reason why we introduced this Nokia Book edition dedicated
purely to ML&AI.

Authors have shown what are the important ML algorithms to consider, selected
real case-studies from Nokia projects and finally various ML software development
aspects which are prerequisite to build effective ML&AI solutions. Without a doubt
this branch of science impacts on our life now and will do this in the future as well.

Book is recommended for both enthusiasts of telecommunication and AI&ML so they
can discover how future of telecommunication will look like.

I would like to thank the authors for this journey into the future, for their effort and
for great involvement in that project realization.

I wish you a pleasant read,
